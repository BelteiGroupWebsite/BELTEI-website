    BELTEI International School General Chinese Program
    Aims to create a better foundation for learning Chinese
    Whose native language is not Chinese to meet the needs of a competitive job market
    At present, as well as the requests of parents and guardians.

    We use the latest textbooks, including "Chinese Vocabulary" and
    "Chinese Calligraphy", an Internal Textbook Compiled by BELTEI International School
    Combined with YCT and HSK books that can guarantee
    Students can learn Chinese fluently in listening, reading, writing and speaking
    And short and efficient translation
    As well as ensuring that students who complete Level 6 can have the same ability as YCT4
    Students who have completed Level 9 may have the equivalent of HSK4-5
    And students who have completed grade 12 may have the same level of ability as HSK5-6.
    Our program per course lasts 6 months equal to 195 hours (part-time classes).
    Not only that, the school also incorporates curricula such as public speaking competitions
    Chinese writing and cultural programs
    To promote the learning of Chinese students to be more diverse and better.
